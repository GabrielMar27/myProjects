        <button class="Coll">Model Lineup</button>
        <p>
          The 2014 E-Class comes in 11 models: E350 Coupe ($52,200), E350
          Cabriolet ($60,200), E350 4MATIC Coupe ($54,700), E550 Coupe
          ($59,000), E550 Cabriolet ($67,300), E250 BlueTEC Sedan ($51,400),
          E250 BlueTEC 4MATIC Sedan ($53,900), E350 Sedan ($51,900), E350 4MATIC
          Wagon ($54,400), E550 4MATIC Sedan ($56,700), and E400 HYBRID Sedan
          ($61,400).
          <br></br> Depending on the model, they come in Luxury or Sport trim,
          or just Sport. The E350 uses a 3.5-liter V6, the E550 a 4.6-liter twin
          turbo V8, the BlueTECs a 2.1-liter four-cylinder turbodiesel. There
          are three super-high-performance E63 AMG models.
          <br></br> Standard equipment on
          the E350 Coupe and Cabriolet, E550 Coupe and Cabriolet, and E350
          4MATIC coupe includes every power thing imaginable. New standard
          equipment includes Eco start/stop.
          <br></br> Safety equipment standard on all
          models includes 10 airbags, active head restraints, electronic
          stability control, anti-lock brakes with brake assist, rollover
          sensor, rearview camera, and tire pressure monitor. New standard
          safety equipment includes Collision Prevention Assist, Attention
          Assist, and LED headlamps and taillights. Optional equipment includes
          full LED lighting, surround view camera, and parking assist. The
          Driver Assistance Package includes steering assist, lane-keeping
          assist, cross-traffic assist, rear-end collision assist, and
          pedestrian recognition assist.

        <button class="Coll">Walkaround</button>
        <p>The new 2014 E-Class looks way more dynamic than the 2013. It's improved in every angle and direction, unless your taste in Benz design is rigid. It's edgy and sporty now, especially in the front end. The new face might be faulted for being less smooth than it might, but it brings the E-Class alive.
        <br></br>
        The LED headlamps are bigger and sleeker for 2014, and the grille is bigger and blacker, with only two bars and the big Benz star moved into the center. But it's the AMG models, with wide flowing faux air intakes in each corner and a wide horizontal dam below the bumper, that make the E look like it's trying to be a Mustang. Mercedes prefers to say the styling forms a visual link to the brand's high-performance sports car models. This describes the Sport trim, not Luxury, which is less changed, with the star still a hood ornament. Sport places the three-pointed star on the grille.

<br></br>
The character lines on the sides are smoother now, with gently rising shoulder lines to the trunk lid, under windows unbroken by B-pillars. Horizontal LED taillamps widen the view from the rear. Overall it's elegant, dynamic and poised, says Mercedes, and we agree.</p>
</p>
<button class="Coll">Interior Features</button>
<p>
The interior is less changed for 2014. Gone is the gear selector lever on two-door E-Class, making room for storage and big cupholders. It makes sense to create usable space when mechanically possible. Shifting is back to the future, with a lever on the right side of the steering column. It's not like your father's Oldsmobile, trust us, we own one.
The dashboard is smoother, every inch soft touch, with new two-piece trim in burl walnut, black ash, or brown satin ash. Mercedes says there are virtually unlimited possibilities for individual configuration of exterior and interior colors. We don't know about that, but we can sure say that beige leather and brown satin ash in the black wagon is beautiful, as is gray leather and black ash in the hybrid. Changes on the instrument panel include a new cluster with nice off-white gauges, and sleeker air vents with an analog clock between them. Console switches are now dipped in chrome.
A new multi-function three-spoke steering wheel with optional flat bottom is small enough to make the car feel smaller, and large enough to control the car with precision.
The E-Class Cabriolet is the quietest soft top in its class, after careful development with high acoustic standards. Mercedes says wind noise scarcely penetrates it, and we'll have to take their word for it, because we enjoyed the topless driving so much we forgot it had a top. Come to think of it, we didn't see any other journalists driving with the top up. It looks handsome in pictures.
The seats are a bit different in the models. In the Cabriolets, our seats had a nice Recaro-like fit, ribbed leather, on the firm side. Mercedes says you're here to drive, not kick back.
Every time we looked in the driver's side window, in the models we drove, we saw the vents on the dashboard. It's a common reflection to see in cars at times, but on this day it seemed like the vents were painted in the window. Check it in your test drive.
The 2014 Coupe and Cabriolet are fitted with standard COLLISION
PREVENTION ASSIST, a radar-based collision warning system with adaptive brake assist systems, designed to do what it says in all caps.
Also standard is ATTENTION ASSIST, which perceives with sensors any inattentiveness or drowsiness (and we do mean any, that's the root problem with these systems; the debate is a long story, and will get longer in the future) and furthermore tells the driver just how inattentive he or she is, by nagging to drive straight to the nearest espresso booth and get a shot in the dark. Better yet, take a nap. If you don't need quite that much ATTENTION to assist you in driving safely, you can turn it down, or off, as you can with most of these features.
Now for the optional safety things. We won't call them tricks. First there's 3 DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist, which brings us the day we've been waiting for, the robot takes over the wheel. We knew Mercedes would be the first, they've been working on it for decades. There's a gentle tug on the wheel to keep you from danger, as seen by the camera that is the eyes of Intelligent Drive. We experienced false alarms with this system on. We can see how it could save lives, but there are also false alarms and unintended consequences. The haptic warning in the steering wheel sure beats being beeped at, like other cars. In the Cadillac you can set it at a beep or a buzz in your butt. The Mercedes vibe-vibe in the steering wheel feels about like running over metallic reflectors on the freeway.

<button class="Coll">Summary</button>
<p>The 2014 Mercedes-Benz E-Class features new styling, electronic safety enhancements (Intelligent Drive), and a new 7-speed automatic transmission. Eleven models range from a high-performance V8 Cabriolet to a new four-cylinder clean turbo-diesel sedan that gets 40 mpg and makes the Hybrid less attractive. There are three high-performance E63 AMG models. 4MATIC all-wheel drive is available throughout the line.</p>
